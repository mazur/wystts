# Why you should talk to strangers.

This contains sample code used in my presentation "Why you should talk to strangers". The code is guaranteed to, at least, compile on OSX.

You can compile the code by running 'rake'. Given that you have all the compilers installed this should compile the code and put the results in the 'bin' directory.
